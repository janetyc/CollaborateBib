# Quality Control
## Overview

### Task design
- redundancy [ESP Game, CHI04, reCAPTCHA, 2008]
- ground truth seeding
- gold standard task
- automatic check


### Workflow design
- multiple-stage workflow
  - find-fix-verify design pattern  [UIST’10, Soylent]
  - price-divide-solve [CSCW’12, Turkomatic]
- iterative & parallel task workflow  [HCOMP10, CSLDAMT ’10]


### People Management 
- qualification test [Mtruk build-in]
- worker management [2012, MobileWorks]
  - worker training 
  - trusted worker pool, blacklist for bad worker
  - manage worker profile for matching suitable tasks


### Strategy design
- organization strategy (as team, collaboration) [CSCW14, Haiyi et al]
- social, learning, financial [CSCW’14] [2012, MobileWorks]
- economic models: game theory
- crowd assessment (Feedback design)
